// Crucial: Mark this API route as public
// This tells Clerk that this specific API handler does not require authentication
// regardless of middleware settings.
// This is often used for webhooks or public APIs.
// However, Clerk's CSRF protection might still apply if the request
// originates from a browser.
// For true server-to-server or non-browser public access, the middleware config below is better.

// **Alternative/Complementary:** Ensure your `middleware.ts` allows this specifically.
// Your current `isPublicRoute` in middleware:
// const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(["/api/vapi/generate"]);
// This is correct.

// **Most direct approach for "public" API handlers in app router:**
// export const publicRoute = true; // This is for `api` routes that don't need auth, effectively.
// HOWEVER, this is specifically for Clerk's *server-side* auth checks,
// not necessarily for bypassing CSRF protection for browser-originated requests.
// Let's rely on middleware and a specific Clerk setting instead.
